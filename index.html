			<p>MalMar Limited is an independent marine engineering consultancy based in South East England and operating worldwide.  We provide surveying services and expert advice on marine engineering matters to the shipping and insurance industries, such as ship owners, ship managers, P&I Clubs, hull and machinery underwriters, average adjusters, lawyers, ship's agents, charterers, and ship yards.</p>
			<p>The company was set up in December 2010 by Ian Mallett Marine Engineer, an independent consultant and surveyor who was previously a staff surveyor with UK-based firms of consultants and surveyors, for whom he worked for over twelve years.  Having served as a Superintendent engineer for International London based merchant fleets, Ian obtained a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College, London University.  He has twenty years experience in the merchant navy and has also worked as a senior technical consultant for an international oil major.  The work as a superintendent engineer included day-to-day running of vessels, together with experience of new buildings, sale and purchase, speed and consumption disputes (Didymi /Gas Enterprise), general average, stevedore damages, hull and machinery (main engine to crane) damages.  Ian is a Chartered Engineer, Chartered Marine Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology and a Member of the Society of Consulting Marine Engineers and Ship Surveyors.</p>
			<p>At present, the company only has one consultant and surveyor; however, it is anticipated that this will be supplemented by suitably qualified professionals in due course.</p>
			<p>The ethos for MalMar Limited is to provide independent, impartial advice at reasonable cost. We aim to be succinct with our initial reporting, expanding on the key aspects at a later stage if required by the client.  Our rates are maintained at reasonable levels by effectively managing our overheads.</p>
